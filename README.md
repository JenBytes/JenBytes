- 🎵 My main hobby is making music. If you search for JenByte you can find my music everywhere where there is music. 
- 👀 I’m interested in web APIs, Open Source and Community-based Projects, Electronic Music Production
- 🌱 I’m currently learning .NET MAUI App Development
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on music based projects, game development and anything else that I think can be benificial for everyone.

- 😄 Pronouns: any pronous are fine (currently I just prefer she/her)
- ⚡ Fun fact: When I first started coding I thought that variable names can only be one char long, because the examples in school where always only using one char.
